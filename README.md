### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Le Tuan Anh is a semanticist who is deeply interested in well-being, languages, and free software.
His main research interests are in computational meaning and theory of language.
He is the author of the [coolisf software](https://pypi.org/project/coolisf/), which provides computational deep semantic analysis by combining structural semantics from construction grammars and lexical semantics from ontologies in a single representation.
The dissertation (2019), source code, and data are available on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/9udjk/).

In his free time, Tuan Anh develops [jamdict](https://jamdict.readthedocs.io/) - a free and open-source Python 3 library for manipulating Japanese linguistic resources: Jim Breenâ€™s JMdict, KanjiDic2, JMnedict, and kanji-radical mappings.
There is an online demo available at: https://jamdict.herokuapp.com/

From Mar 2019 to Apr 2022, Tuan Anh was a [research fellow](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/blip/research-journey-le-tuan-anh/) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore and contributed to the development of [BELA](https://github.com/letuananh/bela) - a pathway for creating, checking, visualizing, and analysing multilingual corpuses of natural languages.

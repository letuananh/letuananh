### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Le Tuan Anh is a semanticist who is deeply interested in well-being, languages, and free software. His main research interests are in computational meaning and theory of language. He is the author of the [coolisf software](https://pypi.org/project/coolisf/), which provides computational deep semantic analysis by combining structural semantics from construction grammars and lexical semantics from ontologies in a single representation. The dissertation (2019), source code, and data are available on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/9udjk/). 

In his free time, Tuan Anh develops [jamdict](https://jamdict.readthedocs.io/) - a Python 3 library for manipulating Japanese linguistic resources: Jim Breenâ€™s JMdict, KanjiDic2, JMnedict, and kanji-radical mappings.

Currently, Tuan Anh is a research fellow at the [Brain Language & Intersensory Perception (BLIP)](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/blip/research-journey-le-tuan-anh/) Lab, at the [Lifespan Research Centre](https://www.facebook.com/lifespanntu), [School of Social Sciences (SSS)](https://sss.ntu.edu.sg/), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
